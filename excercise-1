> Peruse the Official React documentation by Facebook, note down anything interesting you find and discuss learnings with your mentor and Bloc Slack community. In addition, discuss with your mentor a strategy to read documentation more efficiently. This is a critically important skill to develop as software developer, as technologies keep evolving.

A: JSX is optional, and when i looked at the Babel REPL to see the raw JavaScript code, it seems a little more complex
and longer. Using JSX, we can simplify our code. Using this.props, we can pass input data. When you include curly braces inside
your JSX, it will render them as JavaScript expressions. They also recommend using "Babel" language definition for our editor of choice
so that ES6 and JSX code will be properly highlighted. Applications using React usually only have a single root DOM node from which
your app will display. If you find that part of your UI is used several times, you should probably make it into a reusable component.
